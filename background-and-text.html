          Bats are mammals of the order Chiroptera.[a] With their forelimbs
          adapted as wings, they are the only mammals capable of true and
          sustained flight. Bats are more agile in flight than most birds,
          flying with their very long spread-out digits covered with a thin
          membrane or patagium. The smallest bat, and arguably the smallest
          extant mammal, is Kitti's hog-nosed bat, which is 29–34 millimetres
          (1+1⁄8–1+3⁄8 inches) in length, 150 mm (6 in) across the wings and
          2–2.6 g (1⁄16–3⁄32 oz) in mass. The largest bats are the flying foxes,
          with the giant golden-crowned flying fox, Acerodon jubatus, reaching a
          weight of 1.6 kg (3+1⁄2 lb) and having a wingspan of 1.7 m (5 ft 7
          in).

          The second largest order of mammals after rodents, bats comprise about
          20% of all classified mammal species worldwide, with over 1,400
          species. These were traditionally divided into two suborders: the
          largely fruit-eating megabats, and the echolocating microbats. But
          more recent evidence has supported dividing the order into
          Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera, with megabats as members of
          the former along with several species of microbats. Many bats are
          insectivores, and most of the rest are frugivores (fruit-eaters) or
          nectarivores (nectar-eaters). A few species feed on animals other than
          insects; for example, the vampire bats feed on blood. Most bats are
          nocturnal, and many roost in caves or other refuges; it is uncertain
          whether bats have these behaviours to escape predators. Bats are
          present throughout the world, with the exception of extremely cold
          regions. They are important in their ecosystems for pollinating
          flowers and dispersing seeds; many tropical plants depend entirely on
          bats for these services.

          Bats provide humans with some direct benefits, at the cost of some
          disadvantages. Bat dung has been mined as guano from caves and used as
          fertiliser. Bats consume insect pests, reducing the need for
          pesticides and other insect management measures. They are sometimes
          numerous enough and close enough to human settlements to serve as
          tourist attractions, and they are used as food across Asia and the
          Pacific Rim. However, fruit bats are frequently considered pests by
          fruit growers. Due to their physiology, bats are one type of animal
          that acts as a natural reservoir of many pathogens, such as rabies;
          and since they are highly mobile, social, and long-lived, they can
          readily spread disease among themselves. If humans interact with bats,
          these traits become potentially dangerous to humans. Some bats are
          also predators of mosquitoes, suppressing the transmission of
          mosquito-borne diseases.
